# HanoiTower
I made a game named Tower of Hanoi

The Game consist from 3 towers

The mission is to move all the disks to some another tower without violating the sequence of arrangement. A few rules to be followed for Tower of Hanoi are âˆ’
Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time.
Only the "top" disk can be removed.
No large disk can sit over a small disk.

The full progrmam has 4 files c++ and 4 header files

Each file makes a function and each header file gives and recives paramaters like function or variables that comunicates between each other

Inside of Tower_Of_Hanoi.cpp i have the main task where i run an infinte loop(cycle) with the option the games(like rules, manual game and automated game)

Display_Disk.cpp -> makes, initialize and return the 3 towers

Manual_Game_Mode -> For Manual game you have to introduce 2 integers that means from which disk to which disk to move.
For Exemple:\nINPUT:1 2 -> you will move from the top first tower a disk to the top of second tower can move the disk from the top.

Automated_Game_Mode -> have function that are run in the main task where computer plays the game for you.
